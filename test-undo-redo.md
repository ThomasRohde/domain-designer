# Undo/Redo Testing Guide

## Test Cases to Verify

Based on the fixes implemented, here are the key edge cases to test manually in the application:

### 1. First Action Test
- **Expected**: After adding the first rectangle, undo should return to empty state, and redo should bring back the rectangle.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Open the application
  2. Add one rectangle
  3. Press Ctrl+Z (undo) - should remove the rectangle
  4. Press Ctrl+Y (redo) - should restore the rectangle

### 2. Multiple Actions Test
- **Expected**: Perform a series of adds/edits, then undo step-by-step; each undo should restore the immediately previous state. Then redo back forward fully.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Add 3 rectangles
  2. Edit the label of the second rectangle
  3. Change the color of the third rectangle
  4. Undo 5 times - should step back through each change
  5. Redo 5 times - should step forward through each change

### 3. Branching Test
- **Expected**: Undo a few steps, then do a new action. The redo history from the old branch should be cleared.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Add 3 rectangles
  2. Undo 2 times (should have 1 rectangle)
  3. Add a new rectangle (different from the original second rectangle)
  4. Try to redo - should not be possible (redo button disabled)

## Key Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed state recording**: Now saves the NEW state after changes instead of the old state
2. **Fixed initialization**: History starts with initial empty state at index 0
3. **Fixed duplicate handling**: Properly clears redo states even when duplicates are detected
4. **Simplified flagging**: Removed complex state flag, using only ref for undo/redo detection

## Expected Behavior

- First action can now be undone
- Each undo/redo operation moves to the correct immediate previous/next state
- Branching properly clears redo history
- No off-by-one errors in history navigation
