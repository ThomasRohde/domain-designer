# Heatmap Feature – Implementation Review

This review evaluates the uncommitted heatmap feature work against the plan in HEATMAP.md. It covers feature coverage, code quality, UX, performance, and concrete fix suggestions.

## Summary

Overall, the implementation is robust and aligns closely with the plan. The state slice, palette logic, settings UI, CSV import, per-rectangle value assignment, canvas rendering, and export integration are all present and well integrated. A few small gaps remain (notably applying heatmap state on JSON import and CSV comment handling). The UI feels consistent with the app’s style and respects the “color-only” visualization principle.

## Feature coverage vs plan

- Data model and store
  - Rectangle.heatmapValue added. Done
  - Heatmap slice with: enabled, selectedPaletteId, palettes, undefinedValueColor, showLegend. Done
  - Slice integrated in useAppStore with persistence partialize. Done
  - Predefined palettes present. Done
- Settings page (LeftMenu → Heat Map Settings)
  - Toggle enable/disable overlay. Done
  - Palette selection with gradient preview and “Apply Palette”. Done
  - Undefined value color picker. Done
  - Legend toggle. Done
  - Clear all values. Done
  - CSV Import (modal). Done
- Value assignment
  - Context menu “Set Heat Map Value” → modal with slider + input + preview. Done
  - PropertyPanel section with inline edit, status indicators, and preview. Done
- Color calc & rendering
  - heatmapColors.ts with interpolation + caching. Done
  - RectangleComponent uses heatmap color override and recomputes text color. Done
- Export integration
  - HTML/SVG/Mermaid use heatmap colors when enabled. Done
  - JSON includes heatmapState. Done
  - Viewer uses RectangleComponent so rendering will reflect store heatmap state. Partially (see gap below)
- Legend component
  - Floating legend driven by showLegend + enabled. Done

## Notable gaps and fixes

1) JSON import does not restore heatmap state
- Impact: Exported JSON includes heatmapState, but on import the app doesn’t apply it, so heatmap settings/colors don’t carry over, including in viewer usage.
- Where: HierarchicalDrawingApp.handleImport (after processImportedDiagram and settings update).
- Fix: If importedData.heatmapState exists, apply it to store via heatmapActions.
  - Example adjustment (conceptual):
    - heatmapActions.setEnabled(importedData.heatmapState.enabled)
    - heatmapActions.setSelectedPalette(importedData.heatmapState.selectedPaletteId)
    - replace palettes if provided (validate isCustom flags)
    - heatmapActions.setUndefinedValueColor(importedData.heatmapState.undefinedValueColor)
    - heatmapActions.setShowLegend(importedData.heatmapState.showLegend)

2) CSV parser treats comment lines as failures
- Impact: The generated sample CSV includes comment lines (# …). parseHeatmapCSV doesn’t skip those and reports them as failed rows (“Missing value column”).
- Where: src/utils/heatmapImport.ts → parseHeatmapCSV
- Fix: Ignore lines starting with “#” (after trimming) before parsing.
  - Also consider trimming CRLF and ignoring empty columns after commas.

3) Viewer: ensure imported JSON applies heatmap state in read-only contexts
- Impact: Viewer components render via RectangleComponent using store heatmap state. If the viewer path loads a diagram that includes heatmapState, it should set the store accordingly for a faithful view.
- Where: URLViewerPage / ViewerPage load paths.
- Fix: When loading diagram JSON, if heatmapState is present, set it via heatmapActions as above.

4) Minor consistency: export JSON “heatmapState” shape
- Observation: SavedDiagram includes optional heatmapState. Good. Ensure any import-time validation tolerates missing or partial fields and normalizes palettes (sort stops by value).

## Code quality observations

- Good separation of concerns: slice (state/actions), utils (calc + import), components (UI), and export integration.
- Heatmap color computation is cached (interpolate + palette cache). Nice.
- RectangleComponent computes text color based on final background (heatmap-aware). Good accessibility consideration.
- Zustand selection for getHeatmapColor ensures rectangles re-render when heatmap state changes. Reasonable trade-off.
- Bulk operations use setRectanglesWithHistory for single history entries. Good.

Potential refinements (low risk):
- Precompute palette colors when enabling heatmap or after applying a new palette (util already has precomputePaletteColors).
- In PropertyPanel and HeatmapValueModal, clamp and show validation message if input is outside [0,1] (currently clamped silently).

## UX suggestions

- Heatmap Settings
  - Consider immediate palette apply on selection with an “Undo palette” affordance, or keep the existing explicit “Apply Palette” for clarity. Current approach is fine for predictability.
  - Add help tooltip near “Undefined Value Color” explaining when it is used (already described; a tooltip reinforces this).
- Value modal
  - Add keyboard shortcuts: Enter to save, Esc to cancel (already supported in PropertyPanel; adding in modal would be consistent).
  - Show subtle tick marks at 0.25 increments on the slider (visual affordance).
- CSV import
  - After ignoring “#” comments, keep the summary cards (Successful/Failed/Unmatched); they’re clear and helpful.

## Performance

- For large diagrams, the per-rectangle getHeatmapColor calls are amortized by the color cache. If needed, call precomputePaletteColors on enable or palette change.
- Legend is lightweight (pure CSS gradient).
- No obvious re-render traps found; memoization strategy respects interaction state props.

## Quality gates

- Build/Lint/Typecheck: Not executed in this review context. Recommend running:
  - npm run typecheck
  - npm run lint
  - npm run build
- Tests: None added for the new modules. Suggest adding focused unit tests:
  - heatmapColors: interpolation (endpoints, midpoints), cache behavior
  - heatmapImport: header detection, comment skipping, range validation, matching logic

## Recommended next steps (actionable)

1) Apply heatmapState on import (editor and viewer paths)
- Update HierarchicalDrawingApp.handleImport to set heatmap slice from importedData.heatmapState if present.
- Ensure viewer loaders do the same when loading from JSON/URL.

2) Ignore comment lines in parseHeatmapCSV
- Skip lines that start with “#” after trimming.
- Re-test using the generated sample CSV to ensure zero failures from comment lines.

3) Optional polish
- Call precomputePaletteColors(currentPalette) when enabling heatmap or after Apply Palette.
- Add minimal tests for heatmap utilities and CSV import.

With these small fixes, the heatmap feature will be end-to-end complete and production-ready.
