# Zustand Migration Guide for Domain Designer

This document outlines opportunities to simplify and improve the Domain Designer codebase using Zustand for state management.

## Executive Summary

The current codebase uses a complex system of custom hooks with intricate dependencies, props drilling, and state synchronization challenges. Migrating to Zustand would significantly simplify the architecture, improve performance, and enhance developer experience.

## Current Architecture Pain Points

### 1. Complex Props Drilling
The `HierarchicalDrawingApp` component passes ~50+ props through multiple levels, creating maintenance challenges:
- [ ] Rectangle state and operations flow through 4+ component levels
- [ ] Settings need to be passed to deeply nested components
- [ ] Callback functions require careful memoization to avoid re-renders

### 2. Circular Dependencies
Several workarounds exist to avoid circular dependencies:
```typescript
// Current workaround in HierarchicalDrawingApp
const triggerSaveRef = useRef<(() => void) | null>(null);
const triggerSave = useCallback(() => triggerSaveRef.current?.(), []);
```
- [ ] Remove triggerSaveRef workaround
- [ ] Eliminate circular dependency between auto-save and rectangle manager
- [ ] Remove ref-based communication patterns

### 3. State Synchronization Issues
Multiple hooks need to coordinate state updates:
- [ ] `useAppSettings` needs refs to `useRectangleManager` methods
- [ ] `useCanvasInteractions` depends on multiple other hooks
- [ ] Auto-save needs to track state from multiple sources

### 4. History Management Complexity
History is managed across multiple hooks with complex coordination:
- [ ] `useHistory` hook manages the history stack
- [ ] `useRectangleManager` coordinates history updates
- [ ] Manual tracking of undo/redo operations

### 5. Performance Challenges
Extensive memoization is required to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
- [ ] 20+ `useCallback` instances in `HierarchicalDrawingApp`
- [ ] Complex dependency arrays that are error-prone
- [ ] Ref patterns to avoid stale closures

## Proposed Zustand Architecture

### Store Structure

```typescript
// stores/useAppStore.ts
interface AppStore {
  // Rectangle State
  rectangles: Rectangle[];
  selectedId: string | null;
  nextId: number;

    // ... other UI actions
  };
  
  settingsActions: {
    updateSettings: (settings: Partial<AppSettings>) => void;
    updateColorSquare: (index: number, color: string) => void;
    addCustomColor: (color: string) => void;
  };
  
  canvasActions: {
    startDrag: (dragState: DragState) => void;
    updateDrag: (updates: Partial<DragState>) => void;
    endDrag: () => void;
    startResize: (resizeState: ResizeState) => void;

    endResize: () => void;
    setPanOffset: (offset: { x: number; y: number }) => void;
    setZoomLevel: (level: number) => void;
  };
  
  historyActions: {
    undo: () => void;
    redo: () => void;
    saveToHistory: () => void;
  };
  
  // Computed values
  getters: {
    canUndo: () => boolean;
    canRedo: () => boolean;
    getFixedDimensions: () => FixedDimensions;
    findRectangle: (id: string) => Rectangle | undefined;
    getChildren: (parentId: string) => Rectangle[];

  };
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Core Store Structure
- [ ] Install Zustand: `npm install zustand`
- [ ] Create the base store structure with slices for better organization
- [ ] Implement computed values using Zustand's subscribe pattern

### Phase 2: Migrate Rectangle State
- [ ] Move rectangle state and operations from `useRectangleManager` to the store
- [ ] Update components to use store selectors instead of props
- [ ] Remove props drilling for rectangle operations

### Phase 3: Migrate UI State
- [ ] Move `useUIState` functionality to the store
- [ ] Simplify modal and sidebar management
- [ ] Remove complex useEffect patterns for UI coordination

### Phase 4: Migrate Settings
- [ ] Consolidate `useAppSettings` into the store
- [ ] Implement settings persistence with Zustand's persist middleware
- [ ] Remove ref-based workarounds for settings updates

### Phase 5: Migrate Canvas Interactions
- [ ] Move drag, resize, and pan state to the store
- [ ] Simplify event handlers by accessing store directly
- [ ] Remove complex memoization patterns

### Phase 6: Optimize History Management
- [ ] Implement history as part of the store with Zustand's temporal middleware
- [ ] Add automatic history tracking for state changes
- [ ] Simplify undo/redo implementation

### Phase 7: Implement Auto-save
- [ ] Use Zustand's subscribe API for auto-save triggers
- [ ] Simplify save/restore logic with direct store access
- [ ] Remove circular dependency workarounds

## Code Examples

### Before (Current Approach)
```typescript
// Complex props and callbacks in HierarchicalDrawingApp
const handleAddRectangle = useCallback((parentId: string | null = null) => {
  rectangleManager.addRectangle(parentId || undefined);
}, [rectangleManager]);

const handleDeleteSelected = useCallback(() => {
  if (rectangleManager.selectedId) {
    rectangleManager.removeRectangle(rectangleManager.selectedId);
  }
}, [rectangleManager]);

// Props drilling through multiple components
<RectangleRenderer
  rectangles={rectangleManager.rectangles}
  selectedId={rectangleManager.selectedId}
  onUpdateLabel={rectangleManager.updateRectangleLabel}
  onAddChild={rectangleManager.addRectangle}
  onRemove={rectangleManager.removeRectangle}
  // ... 15+ more props
/>
```

### After (With Zustand)
```typescript
// Direct store access in components
const RectangleRenderer = () => {
  const rectangles = useAppStore(state => state.rectangles);
  const selectedId = useAppStore(state => state.selectedId);
  const { updateRectangle, addRectangle, removeRectangle } = useAppStore(
    state => state.rectangleActions
  );
  
  // No props needed - direct store access
  // Automatic re-renders only when used state changes
};

// Simple action calls
const handleAddRectangle = () => {
  useAppStore.getState().rectangleActions.addRectangle();
};
```

## Benefits of Migration

### 1. Simplified Component Structure

## Store Organization Best Practices

### 1. Use Slices for Organization
```typescript
const createRectangleSlice = (set, get) => ({
  rectangles: [],
  selectedId: null,
  rectangleActions: {
    addRectangle: (parentId) => {
      // Implementation
    },
    // Other actions
  }
});

const createUISlice = (set, get) => ({
  ui: {
    sidebarOpen: false,
    // Other UI state
  },
  uiActions: {
    toggleSidebar: () => set(state => ({
      ui: { ...state.ui, sidebarOpen: !state.ui.sidebarOpen }
    })),
    // Other actions
  }
});
```

### 2. Use Selectors for Performance
```typescript
// Define reusable selectors
const selectRectangles = (state) => state.rectangles;
const selectSelectedRectangle = (state) => 
  state.rectangles.find(r => r.id === state.selectedId);
const selectChildren = (parentId) => (state) =>
  state.rectangles.filter(r => r.parentId === parentId);
```

### 3. Implement Middleware for Cross-Cutting Concerns
```typescript
// Auto-save middleware
const autoSaveMiddleware = (config) => (set, get, api) =>
  config(
    (...args) => {
      set(...args);
      // Trigger auto-save after state changes
      if (get().autoSave.enabled) {
        debouncedSave(get());
      }
    },
    get,
    api
  );
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Use Shallow Selectors**: Select only the specific state needed
2. **Memoize Complex Selectors**: Use `useMemo` for derived state calculations
3. **Batch Updates**: Group related state changes in single actions
4. **Leverage Immer**: Use Zustand's Immer middleware for immutable updates
5. **Subscribe Selectively**: Use subscriptions API for side effects
