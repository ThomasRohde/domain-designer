# Hierarchical Drawing Program

A React+TypeScript application for creating domain models and hierarchical diagrams with constraint-based layout.

**ðŸš€ Live Demo**: [https://thomasrohde.github.io/domain-designer/](https://thomasrohde.github.io/domain-designer/)

## Features

- **Grid-based Drawing**: Rectangles snap to a grid for precise alignment
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Create parent-child relationships between rectangles
- **Auto-sizing**: Child rectangles automatically resize to fit within their parents
- **Categories**: Different rectangle types for domain modeling (Channels, Business Support, Products, etc.)
- **Interactive Editing**: 
  - Drag and drop for root rectangles
  - Resize parent rectangles
  - Double-click to edit labels
  - Right-click context menus
- **Save/Load**: Persist diagrams as JSON files
- **Export**: Export to PNG, SVG, PDF, or JSON formats
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history management
- **Professional Styling**: Color-coded categories with professional appearance
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable on desktop, works offline with auto-save

- `Ctrl+Z` - Undo
- `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` - Redo
- `Delete` - Remove selected rectangle

### Export Options

- **PNG**: High-quality raster image
- **SVG**: Scalable vector graphics
- **PDF**: Print-ready document format
- **JSON**: Raw diagram data for backup/sharing

## Progressive Web App Features

This application is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with the following capabilities:

### Installation
- **Desktop Installation**: Install the app on Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **App-like Experience**: Runs in its own window without browser UI

- **Instant Loading**: App loads instantly after first visit, even offline
- **Data Persistence**: All diagrams are saved locally and restored on app restart

### How to Install
1. Open the app in Chrome, Edge, or similar browser
2. Look for the "Install" button in the address bar or menu
3. Click "Install Domain Designer" to add it to your system
4. Launch the app from your desktop or start menu

### Offline Status
The app displays your connection status and auto-save information in the toolbar:
- **Online/Offline indicator**: Shows current network status
- **Auto-save status**: Displays when your work was last saved
- **Save confirmation**: Shows "Saved" message when changes are persisted

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- `HierarchicalDrawingApp`: Main application component
- `RectangleComponent`: Individual rectangle rendering
- `Toolbar`: Top navigation and actions
- `CategorySelector`: Rectangle category management
- `ContextMenu`: Right-click menu
- `ExportModal`: Export configuration dialog

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface Rectangle {
  id: string;
  parentId?: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  w: number;
  h: number;
  label: string;
  color: string;
  category: RectangleCategory;
  type: 'root' | 'parent' | 'leaf';
}
```

### Constraint System

- Parent rectangles auto-resize to contain children
- Child rectangles auto-size to fit within parent minus margins
- Minimum/maximum size constraints per rectangle type
- Grid-based positioning for alignment
