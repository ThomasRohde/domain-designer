# Hierarchical Drawing Program Enhancement Plan

## Current State Analysis

Your `sample.tsx` already implements:
- Grid-based rectangle positioning (20px grid cells)
- Parent-child relationships with auto-sizing
- Constraint-based layout (children fit within parents with margins)
- Basic drag/resize functionality for root rectangles
- Grid packing algorithm for child arrangement
- Z-index management for proper layering
- Interactive selection and manipulation

## Reference Analysis

The EDM.png screenshot shows a sophisticated enterprise domain model with:
- Multiple hierarchical levels (Channels, Relationships, Business Support, etc.)

## Technical Considerations

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Rectangle {
  id: string;
  parentId?: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  w: number;
  h: number;
  label: string;
  color: string;
  category: string;
  type: 'root' | 'parent' | 'leaf';
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Constraint System
- Parent rectangles auto-resize to contain children
- Child rectangles auto-size to fit within parent minus margins
- Minimum/maximum size constraints per rectangle type
- Validation rules for hierarchy depth and structure
