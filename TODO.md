[x] Add descriptions to the rectangle tooltip instead of the name
[ ] Replace the colors in the template loading page with our standard colors
[x] Add a checkbox to the template loading to only add 1-level deep
[x] When changing the rectangle fixed width or height, and the parent rectangle is not locked, we should resize to fit children i real time
[x] When dragging a rectangle by grabbing the purple button the possible target should be selected based on the cursor coordinates. I think, currently the target is selected based on the lower left of the grabbed rectangle.
[x] Change the MARGIN and LABEL_MARGIN to be global settings in the settings page. Changes should affect the layout in real time. We should be able to set the margins in steps of 0.1
[ ] Add a margin to exported SVG
